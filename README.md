# Core's NixOS Configuration Files

[![Flake Checks](https://github.com/coredev-uk/nixos/actions/workflows/nix-check.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/coredev-uk/nixos/actions/workflows/nix-check.yml)

These are my NixOS config files. I recently moved from Arch Linux using i3wm and Hyprland to Nix. I am new at this approach and find it great to work with. This would not be possible without the help of other user configuration files, notably [this repo](https://github.com/jnsgruk/nixos-config) by jnsgruk; this was a great help at getting going.
